### _About me_
I am currently not working. A week ago I finished a German language course, I have a B1 level. In the future, I plan to get a B2 level and go to study as a software engineer. In Russia, he received a secondary education in the profession of an electrician, there is an incomplete higher education in the specialty of civil engineer, industrial and civil construction (he had to leave his studies due to the move). Extensive experience in the organization and management of major repairs and low-rise construction. I have the following abilities: learning ability, self-organization, leadership. We are creating an online project with a partner, one branch of which will be a training [platform](https://skildung.com/).
